NAME
    Sub::Spec::DepChecker - Check dependencies from 'deps' spec clause

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Sub::Spec::DepChecker qw(check_deps);
     my $err = check_deps($spec->{deps});
     print "Dependencies not met: $err" if $err;

DESCRIPTION
    NOTICE: This module and the Sub::Spec standard is deprecated as of Jan
    2012. Rinci is the new specification to replace Sub::Spec, it is about
    95% compatible with Sub::Spec, but corrects a few issues and is more
    generic. "Perinci::*" is the Perl implementation for Rinci and many of
    its modules can handle existing Sub::Spec sub specs.

    The 'deps' spec clause adds information about subroutine dependencies.
    This module performs check on it.

    To handle a new dependency clause, create a checkdep_CLAUSE() into
    Sub::Spec::DepChecker namespace.
